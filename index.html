   <p>I have learned to work independently and as a team through observing my co-workers and picking up the slack<br> 
     This has made me understand various aspects of my job and other people responsibilities.</p>

   <h2> Restaurant Depot</h2>
   <p> I have been working at Restaurant Depot for 3 years.
     My time there has been in the receiving dock, keeping a organized and safe work area.
     I have much experience helping customers which has led me to learn outside of my given responsibilities. 
     I am seen as a patient understanding person.</p>
   
   <h2>Goodwill Easter Seals</h2>
   <p>I have spent 2 years at goodwill. I have been recognized for my stellar work performance and awarded for it.
     My experience has given me the chance to operate heavy machines and become very comfortable using and teaching other co-workers.
